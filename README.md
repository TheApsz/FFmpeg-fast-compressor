Hallo this is a very early build of this thing so low effort readme here we come!

this tool is basically made for discord stupid video size limit so if your video is way too large then you can use this to make the video smaller without going on those shitty ad filled online compressors that require you to pay 12 dollars a month to remove the watermark

// Features:
- easy to use batch file
- video compression

// You need:
- FFmpeg
- a new folder (it creates new folders)
- a brain
